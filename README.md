# Simian CI - Jekyll Landing Page

This is the landing page for Simian CI.

## How to use

1. Make sure you have bundler installed (gem install bundler)
2. `bundle install`
3. `rbenv rehash`
4. `jekyll serve --watch` to serve and watch for changes
5. run `jekyll build` when you want to build the site

## SASS

Jekyll compiles SASS when serving/building. Put your partials in the `_sass` folder, and your `main.scss` file in `css` folder. Your `main.scss` file should have the front matter declaration (dashes at the top of the file) to work correctly.
