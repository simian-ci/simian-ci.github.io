# Context
Here you should write the context/background of the code changes, a
good format to follow is.

* What's the problem/feature
* How what you are doing solves/adds that problem/feature
* Anything you feel will help to understand your changes

## Links
Here you should add links that are related to this Pull Request. For
example:

* JIRA/Trello Links
* Documentation Links

## Media
Normally, if you are working on a feature that has a UI component, you
should add a gif or a video of the behavior otherwise you may just need
an image to do the trick. For gifs/videos we use [recordit.co](http://recordit.co)/

If it's a feature without UI or visual changes you can ignore this part.
